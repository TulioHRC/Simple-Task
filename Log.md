# Log - ðŸ“¶

Like a logbook of the development of my application, to organize the progress of the project and put the ideas somewhere.

## 0.1.1v (Server and Client)
  - Server side creation
  - Client side creation
  - Client side organization
  - Full-Stack test (npm run dev)

## 0.1.0v (Insight)
  - Planning (ReadMe, Log, GitHub repository)

  ### Appearance Idea
  Something simple, but pleasant to see and use, having some little animations like the following example:
  
  https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/Skillex-Online-Education 
  
  And the rest would be something very simple, like this To-Do list:
